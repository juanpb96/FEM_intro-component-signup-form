## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS / SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

In this project, I had the idea of working on a simple layout by just using Flexbox. This time I knew the importance of implementing a `flex-direction: column;` for mobile and change it to row when the screen size is big enough to accomplish the view defined in the design. 


### Continued development

I want to improve the way a write my styles without losing quality or readability, due to the amount of lines I have written. I am curious about discovering different solutions and I will continue improving my SCSS skills.

### Useful resources

- [Email RegEx](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/201323/how-to-validate-an-email-address-using-a-regular-expression) - This info helped me to define a strong regular expression to validate the email in my form according as required.
